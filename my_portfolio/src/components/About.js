    <p>I am a self taught web developer from Glen Allen, Virginia. I started working as an Administrative Assistant in the Hospitality Industry, after I received the work authorization to work here in the USA. After working for about four years in the industry, I realized I had to make a move towards a better future and the job profile, I was working for, wasn't going to make much of a difference. I was determined to learn something new and challenge my limits, hence, I decided to start learning to code. It was a bit intimidating in the begining as I was unacquainted with software developement. In order to start, I had done a lot of digging on the internet, reached out to my friends in the field of Software to gain as much knowledge and resources I could get. Gradually, by watching youtube tutorials, following Udemy courses and freeCodeCamp, I finally learnt the basic of coding.
