            I have worked in the Customer Service industry in the past, that primarily focused on problem solving. After moving into the USA, I have worked as office aministrative assistant, which helped me understand the key aspects of organizational skills, time management, communication skills, quick learning, critical thinking and last but not the least, attention to details.
